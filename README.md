#The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was a 2011 nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Ōkuma, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan.
#R-shiny app was created to visualize the detection of nuclear radiation in the soil using the sample.
#It filters data through the methods by which the radiation was measured. 
#Using ggplot2 a plot was created  that displays the radiation from the radio-nuclides and colours them according to the nuclides within a map of Japan(taken from a Japan dataset from world map). 
#Using plotly a plot was also created which displays the radionuclides in the satellite image taken from US government(Folder: / (nationalmap.gov))
